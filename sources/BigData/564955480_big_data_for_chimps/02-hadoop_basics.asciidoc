In this chapter, we will equip you with two things: the necessary mechanics of working with Hadoop, and a physical intuition for how data and computation move around the cluster during a job. 

Hadoop is a large and complex beast. It can be bewildering to even begin to use the system, and so in this chapter we're going to purposefully charge through the least you need to know to launch jobs and manage data. If you hit trouble, anything past that is well-covered in Hadoop's excellent and detailed documentation or online. But don't go looking for trouble! For every one of its many modes options and configurations that is essential, there are many more that are distracting or even dangerous. The most important optimizations you can make come from designing efficient workflows, and even more so from knowing when to spend highly valuable programmer time to reduce compute time.

The key to doing so is an intuitive, physical understanding of how data moves around a Hadoop cluster. Shipping data from one machine to another -- even from one location on disk to another -- is outrageously costly, and in the vast majority of cases dominates the cost of your job. We'll describe at a high level how Hadoop organizes data and assigns tasks across compute nodes so that as little data as possible is set in motion with both a physical analogy and by following an example job through its full lifecycle. More importantly, we'll show you how to read a job's Hadoop dashboard to understand how much it cost and why. You'll be using a docker simulation of a real Hadoop cluster on your machine. Your goal for this chapter is to take away a basic understanding of how Hadoop distributes tasks and data, and the ability to run a job and see what's going on with it. As you run more and more jobs through the remaining course of the book, it is the latter ability that will cement your intuition.

Let's kick things off by making friends with the good folks at Elephant and Chimpanzee, Inc. Their story should give you an essential physical understanding for the problems Hadoop addresses and how it solves them.

A few years back, two friends -- JT, a gruff chimpanzee, and Nanette, a meticulous matriarch elephant -- decided to start a business. As you know, Chimpanzees love nothing more than sitting at keyboards processing and generating text. Elephants have a prodigious ability to store and recall information, and will carry huge amounts of cargo with great determination. This combination of skills impressed a local publishing company enough to earn their first contract, so Chimpanzee and Elephant, Incorporated (C&E for short) was born.

The publishing firm’s project was to translate the works of Shakespeare into every language known to man, so JT and Nanette devised the following scheme. Their crew set up a large number of cubicles, each with one elephant-sized desk and several chimp-sized desks, and a command center where JT and Nanette can coordinate the action.

As with any high-scale system, each member of the team has a single responsibility to perform. The task of each chimpanzee is simply to read a set of passages and type out the corresponding text in a new language. JT, their foreman, efficiently assigns passages to chimpanzees, deals with absentee workers and sick days, and reports progress back to the customer. The task of each librarian elephant is to maintain a neat set of scrolls, holding either a passage to translate or some passage's translated result. Nanette serves as chief librarian. She keeps a card catalog listing, for every book, the location and essential characteristics of the various scrolls that maintain its contents. 

When workers clock in for the day, they check with JT, who hands off the day's translation manual and the name of a passage to translate. Throughout the day the chimps radio progress reports in to JT; if their assigned passage is complete, JT will specify the next passage to translate.

If you were to walk by a cubicle mid-workday, you would see a highly-efficient interplay between chimpanzee and elephant, ensuring the expert translators rarely had a wasted moment. As soon as JT radios back what passage to translate next, the elephant hands it across. The chimpanzee types up the translation on a new scroll, hands it back to its librarian partner and radios for the next passage. The librarian runs the scroll through a fax machine to send it to two of its counterparts at other cubicles, producing the redundant, triplicate copies Nanette's scheme requires. 

The librarians in turn notify Nanette which copies of which translations they hold, which helps Nanette maintain her card catalog. Whenever a customer comes calling for a translated passage, Nanette fetches all three copies and ensures they are consistent. This way, the work of each monkey can be compared to ensure its integrity, and documents can still be retrieved even if a cubicle radio fails.

The fact that each chimpanzee's work is independent of any other's -- no interoffice memos, no meetings, no requests for documents from other departments -- made this the perfect first contract for the C&E crew. JT and Nanette, however, were cooking up a new way to put their million-chimp army to work, one that could radically streamline the processes of any modern paperful office footnote:[Some chimpanzee philosophers have put forth the fanciful conceit of a "paper-less" office, requiring impossibilities like a sea of electrons that do the work of a chimpanzee, and disks of magnetized iron that would serve as scrolls. These ideas are, of course, pure lunacy!]. JT and Nanette would soon have the chance of a lifetime to try it out for a customer in the far north with a big, big problem.

=== Map-only 作业：单独的处理记录 ===

正如你所猜测，Chimpanzee 和 Elephant组织文件和工作流程的方式与Hadoop处理数据和后台计算正好对应。接下来我们通过一个详细的例子给你展示。

在目录树上的方案包代表业务关系数据库系统。 Nanette是Hadoop的一个主节点，主节点存储的目录树结构（类似卡片目录）和每个文件的数据节点引用（类似图书管理员）。JT是任务追踪的简称，它使每个独立的MapReduce任务进入一个非常连贯的系统并协同工作。让我们从一些尽可能简单的代码入手来阐明Hadoop是如何工作的。

我们也许没有像JT的会多种语言的黑猩猩一样聪明，但即使我们能将一个文本翻译成一种被称作_Igpay Atinlay_的语言。 footnote:[Sharp-eyed readers will note that this language is really called _Pig Latin._ That term has another name in the Hadoop universe, though, so we've chosen to call it Igpay Atinlay -- Pig Latin for "Pig Latin".]. 对于不熟悉Igpay Atinlay语言者，如下两点说明如何 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_latin#Rules[将标准英语翻译成Igpay Atinlay语言]:

* 如果一个词是以辅音字母或者辅音发音的字母开头，将它们移到词尾并加上“ay”，如：“happy”就变成了“appy-hay”，“chimp”就变成了”imp-chay”,进而”yes”就变成了“es-yay”。
* •	如果一个词是以元音开头，仅在词尾加上附加音节“way”即可，如：“another”就变成了“another-way”，“elephant”就变成了“elephant-way”。

<<pig_latin_translator>>  是我们的第一个Hadoop作业，即这个解释器只是把普通的文本文件解释成Igpay Atinlay语言。Hadoop作业只能够记录每一条你认为可以发生的记录，这就是Hadoop作业的最低限能。这使得很容易的知道它是如何发起一项作业；如何跟踪其进展，并通过运行时间、大量的数据迁移来评测Hadoop的性能情况。更重要的事实是，它在平常执行时也使它成为一个最重要的一个实例。通过适当的输入输出，不规则的Hadoop作业还能够进行熟练的超常作业，因此记住这点尤为关键。

让我们来看一个Python的例子，Python是一种通用的数据科学语言，你可以在命令行里通过运行一个文本文件来执行它，或者在超过拍字节的集群上执行它（无论什么原因产生一个拍字节的文本迫切需要翻译成“猪拉丁语”）。

  pig_latin_words = []
  for word in words:
    original_word = ''.join(word)
    head, tail = word
    head = 'w' if not head else head
    pig_latin_word = tail + head + 'ay'
    pig_latin_word = pig_latin_word.lower().capitalize() if CAPITAL_RE.match(pig_latin_word) else pig_latin_word.lower()
    pig_latin_words.append(pig_latin_word)
  return " ".join(pig_latin_words)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  for line in sys.stdin:
    print mapper(line)

for each line,
  recognize each word in the line
  and change it as follows:
    separate the head consonants (if any) from the tail of the word
    if there were no initial consonants, use 'w' as the head
    give the tail the same capitalization as the word
    thus changing the word to "tail-head-ay"
  end
  having changed all the words, emit the latinized version of the line
end

你最好在本地的一个数据子集上开始开发工作，那是因为他们执行起来更快并且更便宜。在本地执行Python脚本，只需在你的命令行里输入如下指令来执行：

------
cat /data/gold/text/gift_of_the_magi.txt|python examples/ch_01/pig_latin.py
------

可能的输出结果如下：
------

------

它在本地执行是如上结果，让我们看看在一个真正的Hadoop集群下执行时它是如何运行的。

注：在本地的一个数据子集上开展开发工作不仅仅是因为更快和更便宜，还有更多原因。更重要的是，然而提取一个有意义的表的子集同时也迫使你去了解你的数据及其数据间的关系。由于所有的数据在本地，会迫使首先找到好的做法“我将会用这些数据做什么”和进一步考虑“我该如何有效的去处理这些数据”。往往初学者会相信其对立面，但经验告诉我们，为准备一个子集的前期投资总是值得的，而不是从一开始就关注效率问题。

=== Data on the cluster

If you've skimmed Hadoop's documentation already, you've probably seen the terms _fully-distributed,_ _pseudo-distributed,_ and _local_ bandied about. Those describe different ways to setup your Hadoop cluster, and they're relevant to how you'll run the examples in this chapter.
We've setup a virtual Hadoop environment for you using Docker, and you can develop and test Hadoop jobs using your laptop, just like having a real cluster. Your jobs will run in fully-distributed mode, making use of the cluster's filesystem called HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System).

Run the following commands to check out what lies on HDFS:

------
hadoop fs -ls .
------

The dot `.` is treated as your HDFS home directory (use it as you would `~` in Unix.). The `hadoop fs` command takes a command and a path, just like the *nix command. In addition to `-ls`, `-cp`, `-mv`, `-rm`, `-cat`, `-head` and `-tail` also work. Now check out /data:

------
hadoop fs -ls /data/gold
------

You'll see some of the data we'll be using throughout the book.

==== Run the Job ====

First, let's test on the same tiny little file we used at the command-line. This command does not process any data but instead instructs _Hadoop_ to process the data, and so its output will contain information on how the job is progressing.

// Make sure to notice how much _longer_ it takes this elephant to squash a flea than it took to run without Hadoop.

------
hadoop jar /usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/hadoop-streaming.jar -file ./examples/ch_01/pig_latin.py -mapper ./examples/ch_01/pig_latin.py -input /data/gold/text/gift_of_the_magi.txt -output ./translation.out
------

.The Job Browser
********
While the script outputs a bunch of happy robot-ese to your screen, open up the job browser at http://$CLUSTER_IP:9001/jobbrowser/ in your browser window. You'll need to login with chimpy/chimpy. The job should appear on the job browser window within a few seconds.

The job browser offers a built-in console for monitoring and diagnosing jobs. It is part of Hue, or "Hadoop User Experience" - a graphical interface for Hadoop.

image:images/01_job_browser_1.png[Hue Job Browser Interface]

You will notice a list of jobs, the only entry being the job you just executed. Columns called map and reduce denote the percentage of completeness for mappers and reducers. Clicking on the job's id will take you to a page summarizing that job. To the left of the page is a box summarizing the job: user, status, a link to logs, as well as a count of maps and reduces and the duration of the job. You can also view the logs of the job, which is helpful during debugging.

image:images/01_job_browser_2.png[Hue Job Browser Interface - Job Page]

******

You can compare the job's output to the local execution we ran earlier by running:

------
hadoop fs -cat ./translation.out/*
------

That command, like the Unix ‘cat’ command, dumps the contents of a file to standard out, so you can pipe it into any other command line utility. It produces the full contents of the file, which is what you would like for use within scripts but if your file is hundreds of MB large, as HDFS files typically are, dumping its entire contents to your terminal screen is ill appreciated. We typically, instead, use the Unix ‘head’ or 'tail' command to limit its output (in this case, to the last ten lines).

------
hadoop fs -cat ./translation.out/* | tail -n 20
------

Since you wouldn't want to read a whole 10GB file just to see whether the right number of closing braces come at the end, there is also a `hadoop fs -tail` command that dumps the last one kilobyte of a file to the terminal.

Here's what the head and tail of your output should contain:

image:images/01_pig_latin_output_1.png[Pig Latin Job Output]

Hadoop has its own 'head' and 'tail' commands:

------
hadoop fs -tail ./translation.out/*
------

=== Outro

In the next chapter, you'll learn about map/reduce jobs -- the full power of Hadoop's processing paradigm. Let's start by joining JT and Nannette with their next client.
